# 30-Day Build Log

## Day 1 (Dec 23)

✅ Environment setup (FastAPI, Cursor AI)
✅ First API endpoint working (echo)
✅ GitHub repo created and pushed
✅ Public commitment tweet posted
✅ Anthropic API key configured
✅ Claude SDK installed
✅ /chat endpoint working with Claude Sonnet 4
✅ AI responding to messages
✅ Error handling added
✅ Documentation updated
✅ Document upload feature (PDF and TXT)
✅ Document management endpoints (list, get, delete)
✅ PyPDF2 integration for PDF text extraction
✅ **Document Q&A feature** - Ask questions about uploaded documents
✅ Enhanced error handling (file validation, size limits, specific PDF errors)
✅ Logging system implemented
✅ **Conversation memory** - Chatbot remembers previous messages in a session
✅ **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system** - Document chunking and smart retrieval
✅ **Document chunking** - Documents split into manageable chunks with overlap
✅ **Smart retrieval** - Only relevant chunks sent to Claude (efficient and cost-effective)
✅ **Session management** - Multiple conversation sessions with isolation
✅ **Debug endpoint** - Inspect chunking results for testing
✅ **Semantic search with embeddings** - Replaced keyword matching with AI-powered semantic search
✅ **Embedding generation** - Documents generate embeddings on upload using sentence-transformers
✅ **Cosine similarity** - Uses scipy to calculate semantic similarity between embeddings
✅ **Backward compatibility** - Old documents without embeddings still work with keyword search
✅ **Enhanced debug endpoint** - Shows embedding count and status
